**Known Bugs/ Workarounds:**
  * ~~Clock runs slightly slow (about 1 second slow ever 30-35 seconds)~~
    * Fixed by redoing clock system with System.getTimeInMillis() instead of java.swing.Timer
  * ~~Images wonâ€™t show, and/or wont rotate~~
    * Fixed by using AffineTransform and BufferedImage
  * Mouse alignment with buttons and gun aiming is slightly off
    * Caused by the thickness of the title bar at the top, and it's different for mac and windows.
